# LearningSETGame

SET is a popular online puzzle game, accessible [here] (http://www.setgame.com/set/puzzle), where users attempt to group cards based on the presence or absence of certain features. Users are provided 12 cards and asked to determine the 6 triples of cards which either all disagree or agree on the characteristics of color, shading, number, and shape. This game helps users build their critical thinking skills and become famililar with sets, which can open the door to set theory. While the game is fun to play, there is a learning curve; it took me almost a year to fully grasp all of the rules and play with confidence.

# Goal

Create a program to teach users to play SET. 

Instead of simply providing users with a list of rules and numerous groups of cards, my goal is to create a program that will react to a user's failed and successful attempts at selecting sets, and provide advice for the user on how to proceed with playing the game. 

To achieve this, I will have two "modes." Player mode will simply allow you to play the game, just as it is available online. 

Another mode, called Learner Mode, will shrink the scale of the game so users are only playing with 6 cards and asked to find the single triple of cards which agree or disagree on all their features. Then, based on the attempts by the user to choose the correct set with their first grouping of 6 cards, the program will generate a new grouping of 6 cards that allow users to practice identifying sets with characteristics similar to the ones they had difficulty identifying earlier. This will continue until the user exits out of this second mode. 

# Currently

I am currently working on the front-end to make the website where these programs will be hosted. I am also currently working on making the first mode of the game, where SET can simply be played.
